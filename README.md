# Polly.Contrib.BlankTemplate

Polly.Contrib.BlankTemplate is blank template to use a starting point to develop contributions to Polly.Contrib.

_If you are looking to develop a custom policy, start instead from the repo_ [Polly.Contrib.CustomPolicyTemplates](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.CustomPolicyTemplates).

## How to use the template

This repo is essentially just a blank template of a solution that:

+ references [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)
+ contains multi-targeting for the current compilation targets which Polly supports
  - builds against Net Standard 1.1 and Net Standard 2.0
  - tests againt .Net Core 1.1, .Net core 2.0, .Net Framework 4.6.2, .Net Framework 4.7.2
+ contains a build script which builds to a nuget package styled  `Polly.Contrib.X`

## Getting your contribution included in Polly.Contrib

Reach out to the Polly team at our [slack channel](http://pollytalk.slack.com) or the main [Polly project Github](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly).

We can set up a repo in the Polly.Contrib organisation - you'll have full rights to this repo, to manage and deliver your awesomeness to the Polly community!

If you already have your contribution in a github repo, we can also just move the existing repo into the Polly.Contrib org - you still retain full rights over the repo and management of the content, but the contrib gets official recognition under the Polly.Contrib banner.
